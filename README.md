### Itty Bitty Mutant Parasites
You have been miniaturized to 1/47th of your size inside a Quantum Spacetime Capsule in order to personally eradicate a species of hostile itty bitty little mutant parasites.

Your mission is to navigate the cells within the host and destroy all parasites in each cell. Due to the nature of the Quantum Spacetime Capsule, time slows down when you are at rest and speeds up while in motion.

The Capsule is equipped with a Beam Weapon that reflects off of walls. Hold Right Mouse Button to aim, then press Left Mouse Button to fire. Line up your shots to take out multiple targets in one shot to get a higher score.
(Note: The piercing effect of the Beam is currently buggy and Iâ€™m working on a fix).

### Controls
- WASD: Move
- Hold Right Mouse: Aim
- Left Mouse: Fire
